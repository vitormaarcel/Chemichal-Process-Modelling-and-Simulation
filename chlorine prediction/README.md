# Chlorine Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the chlorine concentration of a water sample using regression. The provided data includes mass, concentrations of sodium and potassium in the file "entrada.csv" and the chlorine data is in "saida.csv" file. As activativation function, the regressor makes use of the Hyperbolic Tangent function.
